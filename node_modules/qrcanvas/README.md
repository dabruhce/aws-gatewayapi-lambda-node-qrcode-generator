This is a QRCode generator written in pure javascript.

Based on [Kazuhiko Arase's QRCode](http://www.d-project.com/).

The only requirement is that the browser works with a `canvas`,
which is supported by most modern browsers.

Installation
---

``` sh
$ npm i qrcanvas
```

Quick Start
---

* Use in modules

  ``` js
  import qrcanvas from 'qrcanvas';
  ```

* Use in browser

  You can either build the code or get released files from <https://unpkg.com>.

  ``` html
  <div id="qrcode"></div>

  <script src="https://unpkg.com/qrcanvas"></script>
  ```

  ``` js
  var canvas = qrcanvas({
    data: 'hello, world'
  });
  document.getElementById('qrcode').appendChild(canvas);
  ```

* Use in Node.js

  [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) is required in Node.js.

  ``` js
  const fs = require('fs');
  const qrcanvas = require('qrcanvas/dist/qrcanvas.node.js');
  const canvas = qrcanvas({
    data: 'hello, world'
  });
  // canvas is an instance of `node-canvas`
  canvas.pngStream().pipe(fs.createWriteStream('qrcode.png'));
  ```
